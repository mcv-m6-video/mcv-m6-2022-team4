Each week's work is put into its own folder. Check the folders for more detailed information about the code.

<h3> Week 1 </h3>
<h5> Main Task: </h5> 
Implement and use mAP for the object detection of a video, find error in optical flow, visualize the flow.
<br> <br>
<b> Tasks: </b>
<ol>
<li> Bounding box detection by adding noise to ground truth
<li> Calculation of mAP for YOLO3, MaskRCNN, SSD
<li> Optical flow visualization
<li> MSEN and PPEN calculation
</ol>

<h3> Week 2 </h3>
<h5> Main Task: </h5>
